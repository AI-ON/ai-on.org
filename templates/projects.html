            <p style="font-size: 14px;">Our problems are divided in two groups: applied research, and fundamental research.
            <br><br>
            <b>Applied research problems</b> are ideal for students looking to develop their expertise in machine learning and deep learning while doing novel work and having a meaningful impact on the world.
            <br><br>
            <b>Fundamental research problems</b> are ambitious and important problems for which no solution exists today, and which may not even be fully solvable in the near future.
