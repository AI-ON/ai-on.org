## Abstract

Experiments are proposed to explore a
novel prior for representation learning,
which can be combined with other priors in
order to help disentangling abstract factors
from each other. It is inspired by the phenomenon
of consciousness seen as the formation
of a low-dimensional combination
of a few concepts constituting a conscious
thought, i.e., consciousness as awareness
at a particular time instant. This provides
a powerful constraint on the representation
in that such low-dimensional thought vectors
can correspond to statements about reality
which are true, highly probable, or
very useful for taking decisions. Instead
of making predictions in the sensory (e.g.
pixel) space, the consciousness prior allows
the agent to make predictions in the abstract
space, with only a few dimensions
of that space being involved in each of
these predictions. Experiments on a synthetic
dataset are proposed to validate some
of the mechanisms proposed to implement
the consciousness prior, in the simplest scenario
where the consciousness mechanism
is only used to make a prediction.
