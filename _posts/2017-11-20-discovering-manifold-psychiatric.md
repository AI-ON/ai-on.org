## Abstract

Psychiatric disorders are amongst the most difficult to accurately diagnose and
design a treatment plan for. Imaging the structural and functional properties of an
individualâ€™s brain is the key to solving this challenge. Current machine learning
approaches fail to utilize the information in these brain scans. Broadly, we propose
finding a manifold of structural and/or functional brain scans in an embedding space
that clusters mental disease states into clinically recognized classes. Specially, we
propose a flavour of the adversarial autoencoder to accomplish this task. The goal
is wide and ambitious enough to accommodate several other alternatives to solve
this challenge.
